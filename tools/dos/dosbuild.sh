#!/bin/bash
# dosbuild.sh - run a DOS command (or a build.bat) inside DOSBox-X
# headlessly, capturing output to disk. Designed for byte-exact build loops
# with vintage Microsoft toolchains (MASM 4.0 + MSC 4.0).
#
# Usage:
#   dosbuild.sh <work_dir> <bat_file>
#
# Where:
#   work_dir   - directory that will be mounted as C: in DOSBox.
#                MUST already contain CL.EXE / MASM.EXE / LINK.EXE etc.
#   bat_file   - .BAT file inside work_dir to run after C: is mounted.
#
# Conventions:
#   - The .BAT MUST NOT use 2>&1 (DOS COMMAND.COM does not support it).
#     Use plain `>` and inspect each tool's exit through its log file.
#   - On success, output files (.OBJ, .EXE, .LOG, etc.) are left in work_dir.
#
